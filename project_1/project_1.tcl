# This file contains the Vivado Tcl commands for re-creating the project to the state*
# when this script was generated. In order to re-create the project, please source this
# file in the Vivado Tcl Shell.
#
# * Note that the runs in the created project will be configured the same way as the
#   original project, however they will not be launched automatically. To regenerate the
#   run results please launch the synthesis/implementation runs as needed.
