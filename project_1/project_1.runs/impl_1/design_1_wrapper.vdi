INFO: [Memdata 28-208] The XPM instance: <design_1_i/axi_dma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_S2MM_FULL.I_S2MM_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_ENABLE_INDET_BTT_SF.I_INDET_BTT/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst> is part of IP: <design_1_i/axi_dma_0>. This XPM instance will be excluded from the .mmi because updatemem is prohibited from making changes to an XPM that is part of an IP.
